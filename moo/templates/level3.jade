  | Hi, There’s this cow that tried to jump over me, and failed.... and he’s kinda just chilling in my curves (not that I actually have curves since its just an illusion created by the sun’s illumination)... but I digress. If you could come find me and get this cow off my back, that’d be greeeeaat. Outer space is kind of big... it’s pretty dark where I am, but I’m pretty sure I’m at moo.psyph.com. Please find me! Sincerely, the Moon.
